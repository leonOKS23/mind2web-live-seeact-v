## Analysis Guidelines

### Sub-task Planning:
- Break down the task into sub-tasks in detail. If the task involves images (e.g., Task: find a good that is similar to the given image), describe the image in your reasoning process.
- Analyze the task status based on the observation and past actions and detail a reasonable future action plan to accomplish the user request.
- You should carefully check ALL THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS to make the plan.
- You should check what you have known based on your past actions and past screenshots.

### Critical Analysis and Reflection:
- Check whether the history actions have accomplished the user request.
- Check the websites, icons, and buttons that are visible on the current screen and might pertain to the user request.
- Critique the past actions and make a decision on the next action, and decide whether to backtrack to the previous steps with actions like: go back, goto [url], scroll [up].
- Assess the feasibility of the current sub-task and the overall task, and decide whether to modify the plan.
- You should carefully check whether ALL THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS of the given task are met.

### List Possible Actions and Decide The Next Step:
- Before you make a decision on the next action, **propose assumptions on the possible actions** and critique them.
- Based on the critique and reflection, make the final decision in the format below:
In summary, the next action I will perform is:
```
{{
    "Element Description": "Optional, the referring expression of the [element] to be operated, e.g., the search bar on the top right of the website under the yellow logo.",
    "Action": "The action to be performed, the possible value is: click, type, clear, hover, press, scroll [down], scroll [up], new_tab, page_focus, close_tab, goto, go_back, go_forward, stop.",
    "Value": [value], specific for the value of press, page_focus, goto, and type actions.
}}
```

## Note:
  	- If you have `scroll [down]` to the bottom of the page, you may `scroll [up]` to go back if needed.
  	- When you hover over a menu item, display its sub-options. Sometimes you can hover over a sub-option, display any further nested options.
  	- If you want to select an option in a dropdown list, you can `click` to see the option and use `type` to select the option.""",
